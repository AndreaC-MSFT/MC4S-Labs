# Short-term workaround for non-US customers using Data Trail in MSM 

## Issue
Currently, the data trail feature in MSM writes dates in US format. This creates issues for customers that use non-US data formats in their local device when they open the generated csv files in Excel as the dates are incorrectly parsed by Excel.

## Status
This issue is being fixed. This article provides a short-term workaround to convert the CSV files into UK format before opening them in Excel.

## Workaround
The workaround consists in a powershell script that converts the CSV files generated by MSM into UK format. Once the csv files are converted, users can open them in Excel.

> DISCLAMER: This Powershell script is provided as-is and it is not officially supported.

Usage:
1. [Download the script](Customize%20calculation%20model.md)
1. Execute the script
    ```Powershel
     .\ConvertToUkDateFormat.ps1 path-to-your-csv-file
    ``` 
1. Open the converted csv file in Excel
